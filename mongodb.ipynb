        "1. **Data Model**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **SQL** → Relational model, organizes data in tables (rows & columns).\n",
        "   * **NoSQL** → Non-relational models such as document, key-value, column-family, or graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Schema**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **SQL** → Fixed schema; structure must be defined before inserting data.\n",
        "   * **NoSQL** → Flexible/dynamic schema; structure can evolve without predefined rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Scalability**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **SQL** → Primarily vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server).\n",
        "   * **NoSQL** → Horizontal scaling (distributing data across multiple servers).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Transactions & Consistency**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * **SQL** → Strict ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n",
        "   * **NoSQL** → Often follows BASE principles (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent), though some NoSQL DBs support ACID for specific operations.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "   * **SQL** → Standardized SQL (Structured Query Language).\n",
        "   * **NoSQL** → Query mechanisms vary depending on type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like syntax).\n",

        "6. **Data Relationships**\n",
        "\n",

        "   * **SQL** → Structured data, complex queries, consistent transactions.\n",
